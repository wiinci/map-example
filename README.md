## Dependencies
- [Vue2Leaflet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue2-leaflet)
- [Leaflet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/leaflet)

## Components

### ElMap
This is a parent component for `MapArea` and `MapControls`. A JSON-formatted map dataset is defined here. This component listens to events emitted from `MapControls`, and uses the arguments passed along with events to set the props in `MapArea`.

### MapArea
A [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) map using [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) data is rendered in this component. The [Vue2Leaflet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue2-leaflet) package provides `VMap`, `VTileLayer`, and `VMarker` components for creating the necessary map layers.

The map always centers on a place, which is currently selected in `MapControls`.

### MapControls
This is a custom component, which lists all places in the map dataset in a sidebar. The first item in the list is selected by default on page load. Users can change the selection any time after the initial load.

A search field in this component allows quick filtering of the dataset. Filtering reduces the number of options in the list and just like on page load, selects the first item in the reduced list. Users see an error message when their search term doesnâ€™t match any place in the list.
